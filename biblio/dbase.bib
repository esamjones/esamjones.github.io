  abstract  = {The principal objective of this chapter is to evaluate the aggregate performance of Mozambique’s tax system against experiences of other developing countries. In the ﬁrst instance, the nature of constraints to tax revenue generation is investigated at the cross-country level. In turn, this framework is applied to the speciﬁc case of Mozambique. By way of structure, Section 2 provides a brief summary of critical perspectives on the Mozambican tax system. This leads, in Section 3, to an analysis of the cross-country evidence for the relationship between developmental conditions and overall tax performance via elaboration of an econometric model. Consistent with previous research (e.g. Teera and Hudson 2004), tax ratios in developing countries are found to be strongly related to ‘deep’ economic and institutional variables. In Section 4 the model is applied to Mozambique, permitting calculation of the expected tax eﬀort based on economic and institutional conditions. Section 5 concludes.},

The comparison in both cases is with farming systems that are “organic by default.” Survey data from a large organic coffee contract farming scheme in Uganda are reported and analyzed using a standard OLS regression and a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimate of the Heckman selection model. The analysis finds that, controlling for a range of factors, there are positive revenue effects both from participation in the scheme and, more modestly, from applying organic farming techniques.},

and behaviour of these instruments in developing countries compared with more traditional
development finance, such as foreign aid. This provides a foundation for analysing past and
present trends in sub-Saharan Africa. It is argued that, like many other low income countries
in the past, sub-Saharan Africa has received negligible inflows of external commercial
financing. If anything, the region has been additionally excluded from these flows due to very
weak levels of financial sector development even compared to other low income countries. At
the same time, recent changes in global and domestic conditions mean that the situation is
evolving rapidly. There is mounting evidence to show that many economies in sub-Saharan
Africa are enjoying significantly expanded access to commercial external capital flows. Given
good prospects that this trend will continue, the playing field for traditional donors is likely to
alter significantly. The brief concludes by reflecting on how donors might respond to these
emerging policy challenges.},

capital stocks sub-divided into education-based categories. The results indicate that
rapid growth since the end of the civil war in 1992 has been mainly achieved through
capital accumulation and concrete improvements in the level of education of the
working population, a governmental priority since Independence. Looking at the
period as a whole (1980-2004), although total factor productivity (TFP) growth has
been robust since 1992 it is as yet unclear whether this represents a firm base to
support high rates of economic growth into the future.},

Economic growth has been robust, international reserves are on the rise and levels of external debt are falling. Combined with the global boom in commodity prices, as well as expansion of Chinese interests in the region, international investors are increasingly viewing Africa as a serious investment option. As a result of these trends, the landscape in which foreign donors have operated is changing rapidly. This paper argues for constructive engagement with this agenda, taking account of the new opportunities and risks that access to global capital markets entails. However, where financial systems are weak, this is likely to require a cautious approach. Even so, over the medium-term, access to new sources of financing may provide a valid and sustainable exit strategy from dependence on foreign aid. As such dependence has characterized many countries in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1980s and 1990s, this emerging agenda demands to be taken seriously.},

  abstract  = {Despite the central role accorded to output growth, there is no consensus as to how it can be increased or sustained over the long run. As a point of departure for this chapter, it is useful to highlight the conceptual distinction between proximate and “deep” determinants of growth. The latter refer to the microeconomic causative processes behind output growth, focusing on dynamics in specific markets over time as well as political economy influences on policy choices. The former take a broader perspective, looking at the patterns of change in macroeconomic aggregates, including overall efficiency. Although the two approaches are complementary, an aggregate focus is essential to developing a coherent overall framework for understanding past dynamics and, thus, identifying core processes of interest. This is the objective of this study. More specifically, the following questions are asked: What have been the aggregate determinants of Mozambican growth to date; What are the challenges to sustaining growth over the long run; and What might other low-income countries learn from the Mozambican experience? To enable this study to provide an evidence-based response, rigorous quantification of the past (proximate) sources of economic growth is undertaken using a growth accounting methodology. To further consider prospects for sustaining productivity growth over the long term a simple macroeconomic growth projections model is elaborated. The results from this exercise confirm the importance of maintaining an unbiased growth pattern in which sustained productivity improvements play a central role. They also show that institutional strengthening, strategic management of foreign aid, and continued expansion of access to education at all levels will be critical.},

Not only can expansion of the public sector weaken economic growth, but also provision of public services may be difficult to re-trench. These issues are relevant to Mozambique as the share of government in GDP already is comparatively high and strategic management of aggregate public spending historically has been weak. A new long-term macroeconomic model quantifies the implications of alternative aggregate spending profiles. It shows that small increases in minimum levels of government spending correspond to large increases in the duration to aid independence. Sharp reductions in aid availability would necessitate significant fiscal and economic adjustments, including cuts in real public spending per capita. For this reason, there is no room for complacency as regards the future of development finance to Mozambique.},

  abstract = {The matter of whether foreign aid is effective in enhancing social welfare in developing countries remains
a quotidian controversy. The present thesis addresses this question empirically and from a variety of
angles. Whilst our understanding of aid effectiveness is far less comprehensive and secure than we
might wish – in part due to the technical challenges of attributing observed impacts uniquely to aid – the
analysis assembled here points to consistent evidence of positive effects of aid at the macro-, meso- and
micro-economic levels. Simply put, there are no grounds to support cynical opinions of foreign aid which
call for it to be ceased. At the same time, much can be done to augment the effectiveness of foreign aid.
The constituent chapters of this thesis may be read independently. Nonetheless, a richer understanding
of the complex and diverse topic of aid effectiveness is gained by taking them as a whole. Chapter 1
provides a more substantive introduction, including a brief overview of the nature of foreign aid, the
particular impact evaluation challenges she presents, and a detailed discussion of the findings of the
thesis. Chapter 2 provides a complementary literature review, which considers existing evidence for aid
effectiveness at various levels of aggregation. In turn this helps pinpoint a number of open and relevant
research questions which motivate the remaining chapters. Chapters 3 and 4 address aid effectiveness from a comparatively aggregate standpoint. The former
takes up the issue of whether aid supports economic growth over the long-run. The latter extends the
analysis to a range of other outcomes, including social indicators, and provides a decomposition of the
main transmission channels through which aid affects economic growth. Chapters 5 and 6 consider two
microeconomic interventions, co-financed by bilateral aid, designed to stimulate organic agriculture in
sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the chapters consider the household welfare effects associated with
smallholder contract out-grower schemes for organic coffee and cocoa located in Uganda.
Chapter 7 considers aid from the supply-side. In part motivated by the recent financial crisis (2008/09),
it seeks to identify the principal domestic determinants of how much aid is given by some of the major
bilateral donors. Finally, Chapter 8 discusses the advantages and disadvantages of a number of innovative
aid instruments. This reflects the fact that aid is not a single coherent ‘thing’, but rather has many facets
and is evolving. For this reason, it will remain an important research topic.},

We account for the bounded nature of land shares and estimate a Pooled Fractional Probit model for panel data. Our results show that crop choice is sensitive to past weather shocks. Farmers shift land use away from cash and permanent crops one year after a drought and from horticulture and permanent crop after a flood. However, this reallocation seems temporary as farmers devote less land to staples after two periods. This is consistent with the aim of maintaining a buffer stock of staples for home consumption.},

First, we show that when poverty is seen as capability deprivation, different individuals are identified as poor compared with approaches based on low income or subjective wellbeing. However, we also observe that what the poor report being able to do or otherwise is, nonetheless, it is relatively robust to the use of these three different approaches. Second, we employ latent class analysis to identify poverty and deprivation profiles for groups within society and suggest that such profiles help to identify groups who are deprived or socially excluded with respect to some but not all areas of life. Third, and finally, we examine the association between individual capability deprivation and local area deprivation in the UK. We find that individual capabilities are associated with local area deprivation in some cases but that the connections vary significantly depending on the dimension under consideration. We discuss the results and conclude by suggesting that capability indicators can provide insights into poverty which do not emerge from a more traditional approach focusing on income alone.},

Focussing on counting-type multidimensional poverty measures, I draw on the properties of positive Boolean threshold functions to prove that the space of feasible poverty definitions is finite and can be partitioned into at most (D2+D)/2 parts, where D is the number of dimensions of well-being spanned by the measure. This provides the foundation for two complementary tests: (i) a bounding approach, which weights each dimension equally; and (ii) stochastic search, where coverage of the space of poverty definitions is assessed via Good-Turing estimates of missing mass. The two methods are applied to a measure encompassing nine dimensions of well-being in Mozambique, revealing persistent regional asymmetries.},

  abstract  = {Malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. It is also a dynamic contributor to poverty through its effects on children’s cognitive development. This paper examines the degree to which malaria in early childhood impacts on educational achievement in later childhood. The substantial decline in malaria in the region over recent years allows an assessment of its impact to be made. Focusing on Tanzania, we combine data from the Malaria Atlas Project and the 2010–2014 Uwezo household surveys (N = 246,325). We relate the district-level risk of malaria in a child’s year of birth to his/her performance in tests of acquired cognitive skills (literacy and numeracy). For causal identification, we rely on differences across districts in the pace of decline in malaria prevalence occurring over the last 15 years. We control for time-invariant district level, age, birth cohort and survey year effects, as well as district-level trends and individual and household-specific factors. In addition, we use sibling variation in birth-year exposure to malaria to strengthen our identification. A ten percentage-point decrease in malaria prevalence in birth year is associated with a 0.06 standard deviation (p = 0.000) increase in English literacy achievement. This estimate is comparable in magnitude to education intervention programs with very large effects. Our results are robust to a large number of sensitivity analyses. We find no statistically significant effects of birth-year malaria exposure on attainments in numeracy and Kiswahili, and we argue that this is probably attributable to strong ceiling effects in these test scores. We conclude that in Tanzania malaria is an important factor in geographical variation in English literacy. This indicates that malaria is a significant public health challenge to educational achievement in this country, and probably in other regions with malaria.},

Here we develop a novel framework that allows different types of catch-up growth to be classified and estimated. We distinguish between catch-up in the mean of a group toward that of a healthy reference population versus catch-up within the group. We show these different growth types can be tested in a unified setting using a latent growth framework. We apply the results to four developing countries, using longitudinal data on 7641 children collected over the period 2002–2013. The results show catch-up growth rates are generally modest but vary significantly between countries, and that local environmental factors are material to variation in child growth trajectories. The paper discusses the benefits of the new framework versus current methods, shows that the method is feasible, and suggests they call for intervention designs that are sensitive to community and country contexts.},

  abstract  = {The impact of commercial farms on smallholders in developing countries remains highly controversial. This study draws on four periods of investments in commercial farming in Mozambique to frame an empirical analysis of their contemporary economic spillovers. We investigate the degree of selection of commercial farms into more favourable locations as well as the extent of heterogeneity in the effects of different commercial farming models on proximate smallholders. The analysis uses survey data covering all large commercial farms in Mozambique and which are linked to a nationally-representative survey of 6000 smallholders. Contrary to widespread assumptions that investors target only marginal farm land, we find that commercial farms are highly selective in their locations, preferring areas close to existing infrastructure and markets. Controlling for selection bias via reweighting and fixed effects, we find the presence of a commercial farm is associated with moderately higher incomes among neighbouring smallholders but a lower incidence of wage employment. Furthermore, these effects vary according to the type of commercial farming in place. More inclusive commercial models, such as those associated with outgrower schemes, appear to generate larger benefits. We conclude that broad generalizations about commercial farming investments must be replaced by more nuanced discussions of alternative investment models.},

Drawing on detailed evidence from Mozambique, we highlight fundamental philosophical tensions in poverty research along three main axes: social ontology (what is the form of social reality?); (b) epistemology (what can be known about poverty?); and (c) aetiology (how is poverty produced?). We argue the quantitative tradition is rooted in an atomistic view of the social world, which is allied to an etic epistemology in which causes and effects are treated as analytically separable. Anthropological work in Mozambique is anchored in an emic perspective, where the diverse forms of poverty are revealed through investigation of their generative mechanisms. This provides a view of poverty as a relational process of social marginalization and directs attention to the diversity of lived-experiences, as well as structural factors that limit individuals’ agency. In clarifying their distinct philosophical commitments, we contend that a forced empirical marriage of the two approaches may be unhelpful. Instead, we recommend the virtues of each approach are leveraged toward genuine mutual dialogue.},

Applying the procedure to data on child height from the Young Lives surveys, as well as cognitive skills, I find that the technology of human capital production is neither log‐linear nor linear‐in‐parameters; rather, past and present inputs act as complements.

Applying a novel decomposition procedure, we find these errors are not driven by incorrect information about labour market returns. Job mismatches of various kinds account for over one-third of the total expectational error, while the remaining error reflects bias from misleading reference points (superstar salaries). While this suggests a need for greater transparency regarding levels of remuneration, we find no evidence that optimistic expectations are associated with poorer labour market outcomes.},

In this paper we identify the impact of this transport infrastructure enhancement on integration of national maize markets. Applying a dyadic regression approach, we find a significant narrowing of equilibrium price differences among market pairs that experienced a large relative reduction in journey times due to the new bridge. We also estimate that the elasticity of the absolute price differential with respect to intermarket driving times is around 30%. As such, the new bridge infrastructure enhanced market integration by shrinking the “internal border” at the river, but such benefits were spatially limited.},

In this paper, we undertake a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of the SDH in Mozambique for the period 2002-2014 based on a set of household budget surveys, covering 152,259 observations. We run logistic regression models, comparing various sets of determinants of health status proxied by two measures: self-assessed overall health and number of days ill. The results, which include models stratified by sex, age and year, consistently show that neither better access to healthcare nor material conditions are related to better health. Rather, macro factors, proxied by place of residence, are the dominant predictor of health inequalities. In the stratified models, women and elders appear more vulnerable to poor health. The policy implication is that a narrow focus of health policy on selected services ignores the underlying economic and social context and their role in producing well-being or poor health. More integrated approaches are required to address the health equity gap in low-income countries.},

We find clear evidence that rates of return to education in the country have shifted over time—declining at lower levels of schooling, but remaining stable and possibly rising at the highest levels. This is consistent with increasingly convex returns, which are most evident among those in non-agricultural (wage) jobs. As such, workers today must accumulate more years of schooling to achieve the same expected return as in the past.},

We create a multidimensional index of lockdown readiness based on living conditions and explore its relationship with forms of trust and the potential for social unrest. The index reveals that just 6.8 per cent of households overall and 12.2 per cent in urban areas meet all conditions for a lockdown. We further show that weak readiness is not offset by high levels of social trust, which can be vital for effective public health interventions. As such, strict lockdown policies may not only be difficult to enforce, but also heighten the risks of conflict.},

This paper revisits how these parameters are understood, revealing they do not uniquely characterise who is identified as poor and that the weights do not reliably reflect each dimensions’ relative importance. Drawing on insights from Boolean algebra, I demonstrate that the set of 'minimum deprivation bundles' constitutes an intuitive and unique characterization of Alkire-Foster identification functions. This provides a formal foundation for various analytical innovations, namely: a novel poverty decomposition based only on the unique properties of each identification function; and metrics of dimensional power, which capture the effective importance or ‘value’ of each dimension across all possible combinations of deprivations. These insights are illustrated using deprivation data from Mozambique and applying various identification functions, including a close replica of the international MPI (multidimensional poverty index).

To address these limitations, I show how the identification procedure can be extended to incorporate any type of positive switching function, represented by the set of minimal deprivation bundles that define a unit as poor. Furthermore, the Banzhaf power index, uniquely defined from the same set of minimal bundles, constitutes a natural and robust metric of the relative importance of each indicator, from which the adjusted headcount can be estimated. I demonstrate the merit of this approach using data from Mozambique, including a decomposition of the adjusted headcount using a ‘one from each dimension’ non-threshold function.},

We further find evidence of heterogeneous updating heuristics, where factors such as the initial level of optimism, cognitive skills, perceived reliability of the information, and valence of the news shape how wage expectations are updated.

We create a multidimensional index of lockdown readiness based on living conditions and explore its relationship with forms of trust and the potential for social unrest. The index reveals that just 6.8 per cent of households overall and 12.2 per cent in urban areas meet all conditions for a lockdown. We further show that weak readiness is not offset by high levels of social trust, which can be vital for effective public health interventions. As such, strict lockdown policies may not only be difficult to enforce, but also heighten the risks of conflict.},

We estimate coercion suppressed workers’ remuneration by about two fifths, representing a significant cost saving to the firm. However, a production function analysis indicates that coercion also negatively affected productivity. Using these results, we calculate the firm’s profitability might have remained broadly robust without forced wage labour.

	title = {Cultivating change: the long-term impact of forced labour in {M}ozambique},
	abstract = {Following the abolition of slavery, various forms of compulsory labour were adopted by colonial powers to develop their economies. This paper analyses the contemporary consequences of compulsory cotton production -- a forced labour system that operated in colonial Mozambique from 1926 to 1961. During this period, the Portuguese colonial government granted geographic concessions to private companies, within which smallholder farmers were forced to cultivate cotton for payment in cash. Women bore the brunt of this regime, but in doing so often took on responsibilities traditionally reserved for men and engaged in active resistance strategies. Employing a spatial regression discontinuity, we explore the enduring impact of this exposure to forced cotton cultivation on present-day human and social capital, focusing specifically on rural southern Mozambique. Our estimation strategy relies on the arbitrarily defined historical borders of the concessions, which reflected the tendency of concessionaires to absorb as much territory as possible, often ignoring agronomic conditions. Drawing on bespoke individual-level survey data collected along the concession border, we find lower educational outcomes among women in former concession areas. However, this is counterbalanced by positive effects on social capital, in the form of higher levels of civil participation, more progressive attitudes towards gender norms, and an increased presence of women in leadership positions. These results suggest that exogenous ruptures that push women outside traditional boundaries can help to reinforce their role in society.},

For that, we focus on a policy of coercive cotton cultivation enforced in colonial Mozambique between 1926 and 1961. We combine archival sources about the boundaries of historical cotton concessions with survey data collected specifically for this study. By employing a regression discontinuity design to compare individuals living in areas inside and outside the historical cotton concessions, we document significant disparities in risk aversion and agricultural patterns between communities. Our findings reveal that individuals living in regions unsuitable for producing cotton but still subjected to the coercive cotton regime have higher risk aversion, are more likely to be farmers, and have more agricultural production destined to be commercialized. These results are mostly driven by women, who felt the brunt of the forced labour regime. As a novel contribution, this paper highlights the long-lasting consequences of colonial agricultural policies on risk and economic behaviour, offering insights into the challenges faced by post-colonial societies in overcoming historical legacies.},

The nature of this relationship seems highly dependent on specific contexts, with empirical studies showing mixed evidence on how economic inequality affects voting and other forms of political participation. This evidence is largely driven by advanced democracies. We have to date limited knowledge on how economic inequality affects how individuals and groups vote in developing and weaker states even though such evidence is central to understanding how democracy might be consolidated in such settings. This paper addresses this question in the case of Mozambique, one of the poorest countries in the world. Contrary to initial theoretical predictions, we find evidence for a positive association between voter turnout and inequality in rural areas, in particular across the poorest localities and in localities where both wealth and inequality increased. While tempting to see this result as a political response of the poorest to inequality, reflections on the Mozambique context point towards elite capture as the most likely explanation for this result. We find no effect of inequality on political competition. In line with prior theoretical expectations, we find a negative association between inequality and voting for the incumbent party, in localities where wealth and inequality simultaneously increased and in the centre region.},

We differentiate between platforms targeting formal jobs, where jobseekers direct their search, and informal tasks, where clients seek workers. Our analysis reveals statistically insignificant intent-to-treat and complier-average treatment effects for headline employment outcomes in the full sample. Notably, while the average male moderately benefits from platform usage, women do not. Rather, they are less responsive to the encouragement nudge, and female treatment compliers report higher reservation wages and lower job search. This suggests digital platforms can inadvertently perpetuate gender disparities in labor markets.},
