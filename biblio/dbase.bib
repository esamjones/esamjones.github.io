  abstract  = {The principal objective of this chapter is to evaluate the aggregate performance of Mozambique’s tax system against experiences of other developing countries. In the ﬁrst instance, the nature of constraints to tax revenue generation is investigated at the cross-country level. In turn, this framework is applied to the speciﬁc case of Mozambique. By way of structure, Section 2 provides a brief summary of critical perspectives on the Mozambican tax system. This leads, in Section 3, to an analysis of the cross-country evidence for the relationship between developmental conditions and overall tax performance via elaboration of an econometric model. Consistent with previous research (e.g. Teera and Hudson 2004), tax ratios in developing countries are found to be strongly related to ‘deep’ economic and institutional variables. In Section 4 the model is applied to Mozambique, permitting calculation of the expected tax eﬀort based on economic and institutional conditions. Section 5 concludes.},

These themes are developed in Section 2, including a brief review of the relevant literature. Based on the authors’ experiences in macro-ﬁscal modelling in Mozambique, Section 3 applies the framework to this speciﬁc case. We ﬁnd that modelling practices have improved over recent years. They are, however, at an early stage of development and a number of weaknesses are obvious. },

As such it provides an example of how forecast evaluations can be undertaken and illuminates some of the key factors which aﬀect the forecasting environment in Mozambique. Based on a unique dataset of forecasts and outcomes for both revenue and macroeconomic variables, the following questions are explored: What are the characteristics of the forecast errors? How have the forecast errors changed over time? How does the forecast model compare to a naive alternative forecast rule? What do the forecast errors tells us about the nature of the tax system?},

  abstract    = {The current boom in global commodity prices and the expansion of Chinese interests in subSaharan Africa are part of a general warming of external investors to the region. This policy
brief examines trends in commercial financial instruments such as equities, bonds and
commercial bank lending and their impact on economic development. It reviews the nature
and behaviour of these instruments in developing countries compared with more traditional
development finance, such as foreign aid. This provides a foundation for analysing past and
present trends in sub-Saharan Africa. It is argued that, like many other low income countries
in the past, sub-Saharan Africa has received negligible inflows of external commercial
financing. If anything, the region has been additionally excluded from these flows due to very
weak levels of financial sector development even compared to other low income countries. At
the same time, recent changes in global and domestic conditions mean that the situation is
evolving rapidly. There is mounting evidence to show that many economies in sub-Saharan
Africa are enjoying significantly expanded access to commercial external capital flows. Given
good prospects that this trend will continue, the playing field for traditional donors is likely to
alter significantly. The brief concludes by reflecting on how donors might respond to these
emerging policy challenges.},
