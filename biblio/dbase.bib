  abstract  = {The principal objective of this chapter is to evaluate the aggregate performance of Mozambique’s tax system against experiences of other developing countries. In the ﬁrst instance, the nature of constraints to tax revenue generation is investigated at the cross-country level. In turn, this framework is applied to the speciﬁc case of Mozambique. By way of structure, Section 2 provides a brief summary of critical perspectives on the Mozambican tax system. This leads, in Section 3, to an analysis of the cross-country evidence for the relationship between developmental conditions and overall tax performance via elaboration of an econometric model. Consistent with previous research (e.g. Teera and Hudson 2004), tax ratios in developing countries are found to be strongly related to ‘deep’ economic and institutional variables. In Section 4 the model is applied to Mozambique, permitting calculation of the expected tax eﬀort based on economic and institutional conditions. Section 5 concludes.},

  abstract  = {The initial objective of this chapter is to propose a general set of principles for the evaluation of macro-ﬁscal modelling at the country level. These themes are developed in Section 2, including a brief review of the relevant literature. Based on the authors’ experiences in macro-ﬁscal modelling in Mozambique, Section 3 applies the framework to this speciﬁc case. We ﬁnd that modelling practices have improved over recent years. They are, however, at an early stage of development and a number of weaknesses are obvious. },

  abstract  = {This chapter breaks with reviews the quality of macroeconomic and revenue forecasts in Mozambique for the period 1995-2005. As such it provides an example of how forecast evaluations can be undertaken and illuminates some of the key factors which aﬀect the forecasting environment in Mozambique. Based on a unique dataset of forecasts and outcomes for both revenue and macroeconomic variables, the following questions are explored: What are the characteristics of the forecast errors? How have the forecast errors changed over time? How does the forecast model compare to a naive alternative forecast rule? What do the forecast errors tells us about the nature of the tax system?},
