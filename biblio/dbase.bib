  abstract  = {The principal objective of this chapter is to evaluate the aggregate performance of Mozambique’s tax system against experiences of other developing countries. In the ﬁrst instance, the nature of constraints to tax revenue generation is investigated at the cross-country level. In turn, this framework is applied to the speciﬁc case of Mozambique. By way of structure, Section 2 provides a brief summary of critical perspectives on the Mozambican tax system. This leads, in Section 3, to an analysis of the cross-country evidence for the relationship between developmental conditions and overall tax performance via elaboration of an econometric model. Consistent with previous research (e.g. Teera and Hudson 2004), tax ratios in developing countries are found to be strongly related to ‘deep’ economic and institutional variables. In Section 4 the model is applied to Mozambique, permitting calculation of the expected tax eﬀort based on economic and institutional conditions. Section 5 concludes.},

The comparison in both cases is with farming systems that are “organic by default.” Survey data from a large organic coffee contract farming scheme in Uganda are reported and analyzed using a standard OLS regression and a full information maximum likelihood (FIML) estimate of the Heckman selection model. The analysis finds that, controlling for a range of factors, there are positive revenue effects both from participation in the scheme and, more modestly, from applying organic farming techniques.},

and behaviour of these instruments in developing countries compared with more traditional
development finance, such as foreign aid. This provides a foundation for analysing past and
present trends in sub-Saharan Africa. It is argued that, like many other low income countries
in the past, sub-Saharan Africa has received negligible inflows of external commercial
financing. If anything, the region has been additionally excluded from these flows due to very
weak levels of financial sector development even compared to other low income countries. At
the same time, recent changes in global and domestic conditions mean that the situation is
evolving rapidly. There is mounting evidence to show that many economies in sub-Saharan
Africa are enjoying significantly expanded access to commercial external capital flows. Given
good prospects that this trend will continue, the playing field for traditional donors is likely to
alter significantly. The brief concludes by reflecting on how donors might respond to these
emerging policy challenges.},

Sustained aid flows to Mozambique, in conflict and post-conflict periods, have made an unambiguous, positive contribution to rapid growth since 1992.

To sustain growth, Mozambique must maximize benefits from natural resources while promoting constructive international market integration.},

consistent time series data covering private and public capital stocks as well as human
capital stocks sub-divided into education-based categories. The results indicate that
rapid growth since the end of the civil war in 1992 has been mainly achieved through
capital accumulation and concrete improvements in the level of education of the
working population, a governmental priority since Independence. Looking at the
period as a whole (1980-2004), although total factor productivity (TFP) growth has
been robust since 1992 it is as yet unclear whether this represents a firm base to
support high rates of economic growth into the future.},

  abstract    = {Recent years have seen a considerable shift in economic conditions in sub-Saharan Africa. Economic growth has been robust, international reserves are on the rise and levels of external debt are falling. Combined with the global boom in commodity prices, as well as expansion of Chinese interests in the region, international investors are increasingly viewing Africa as a serious investment option. As a result of these trends, the landscape in which foreign donors have operated is changing rapidly. This paper argues for constructive engagement with this agenda, taking account of the new opportunities and risks that access to global capital markets entails. However, where financial systems are weak, this is likely to require a cautious approach. Even so, over the medium-term, access to new sources of financing may provide a valid and sustainable exit strategy from dependence on foreign aid. As such dependence has characterized many countries in sub-Saharan Africa during the 1980s and 1990s, this emerging agenda demands to be taken seriously.},

  abstract  = {Despite the central role accorded to output growth, there is no consensus as to how it can be increased or sustained over the long run. As a point of departure for this chapter, it is useful to highlight the conceptual distinction between proximate and “deep” determinants of growth. The latter refer to the microeconomic causative processes behind output growth, focusing on dynamics in specific markets over time as well as political economy influences on policy choices. The former take a broader perspective, looking at the patterns of change in macroeconomic aggregates, including overall efficiency. Although the two approaches are complementary, an aggregate focus is essential to developing a coherent overall framework for understanding past dynamics and, thus, identifying core processes of interest. This is the objective of this study. More specifically, the following questions are asked: What have been the aggregate determinants of Mozambican growth to date; What are the challenges to sustaining growth over the long run; and What might other low-income countries learn from the Mozambican experience? To enable this study to provide an evidence-based response, rigorous quantification of the past (proximate) sources of economic growth is undertaken using a growth accounting methodology. To further consider prospects for sustaining productivity growth over the long term a simple macroeconomic growth projections model is elaborated. The results from this exercise confirm the importance of maintaining an unbiased growth pattern in which sustained productivity improvements play a central role. They also show that institutional strengthening, strategic management of foreign aid, and continued expansion of access to education at all levels will be critical.},

Not only can expansion of the public sector weaken economic growth, but also provision of public services may be difficult to re-trench. These issues are relevant to Mozambique as the share of government in GDP already is comparatively high and strategic management of aggregate public spending historically has been weak. A new long-term macroeconomic model quantifies the implications of alternative aggregate spending profiles. It shows that small increases in minimum levels of government spending correspond to large increases in the duration to aid independence. Sharp reductions in aid availability would necessitate significant fiscal and economic adjustments, including cuts in real public spending per capita. For this reason, there is no room for complacency as regards the future of development finance to Mozambique.},
