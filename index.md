I'm an applied/empirical development economist, with a broad range of interests, but with a particular focus on topics in labour, education, diagnostic methods (e.g., decompositions) and policy macroeconomics, including aid effectiveness.

Currently, I am a Research Fellow with [UNU-WIDER](https://www.wider.unu.edu) in Mozambique, based at the Ministry of Economy and Finance (Maputo). I am also an [Associate Professor](https://www.economics.ku.dk/staff/vip/?pure=en/persons/335694) at the University of Copenhagen, Department of Economics, with the [Development Economics Research Group](https://www.econ.ku.dk/derg/). But I am currently on leave of public service from this position. I've worked with the government of Mozambique for over 10 years sitting in their economic studies and macroeconomic analysis division. 

This is my __personal website__, where you can find my [academic publications](https://esamjones.github.io/publications/), general writing, recent presentations (in my [CV](https://esamjones.github.io/cv/)) and so on.
