excerpt: "About Me..."
---

I am a research fellow with UNU-WIDER, based in Mozambique, working mostly out of the Minsitry of Economy and Finance. I am on leave from my position a an Assistant Professor at the University of Copenhagen, Department of Economics, where I sit in the Development Economics Research Group.

This _personal_ website serves as a repository of my academic publications, general commentary (blogs etc.) and curated links, largely about Mozambique.

Feel free to browse or get in contact with me if you have any questions or ideas.
