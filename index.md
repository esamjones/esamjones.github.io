## Welcome

I am a Research Fellow with [UNU-WIDER](https://www.wider.unu.edu), based in Mozambique, based principally at the Ministry of Economy and Finance. I am on leave from my position as an [Associate Professor](https://www.economics.ku.dk/staff/vip/?pure=en/persons/335694) at the University of Copenhagen, Department of Economics, where I sit in the [Development Economics Research Group](https://www.econ.ku.dk/derg/).

This _personal_ website serves as a repository of my academic publications, general commentary (blogs etc.) and curated links, largely about Mozambique.

Click [here](https://igmozambique.wider.unu.edu/) to see more about our 'Inclusive Growth in Mozambique' project.

Please feel free to browse this site or get in contact with me if you have any questions or ideas.
