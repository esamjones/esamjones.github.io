I am a Research Fellow with [UNU-WIDER](https://www.wider.unu.edu), based in Mozambique, based principally at the Ministry of Economy and Finance. 

Currently, I am on leave from my position as an [Associate Professor](https://www.economics.ku.dk/staff/vip/?pure=en/persons/335694) at the University of Copenhagen, Department of Economics, where I sit in the [Development Economics Research Group](https://www.econ.ku.dk/derg/).

This is my __personal website__ !!under construction!!, which serves as a repository of my academic publications, general commentary (blogs etc.), curated links (largely about Mozambique) and so on.

Click [here](https://igmozambique.wider.unu.edu/) to find out more about our 'Inclusive Growth in Mozambique' project.

Enjoy browsing this site, or get in contact with me if you have any questions/comments.
